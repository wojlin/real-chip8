# Security Policy

## Hardware Safety Guidelines

The CHIP8 Machine is a DIY project involving various electronic components. To ensure the safety and longevity of your device, please follow these guidelines:

### 1. Double-Check Connections
- **Correct Wiring:** Always verify that all connections are made according to the provided wiring diagrams. Incorrect wiring can cause short circuits, damage components, or even pose a fire risk.
- **Polarity Matters:** Pay attention to the polarity of LEDs, capacitors, and other polarized components. Reversing polarity can lead to component failure.

### 2. Power Supply Precautions
- **Use the Correct Power Supply:** Ensure that you are using a 5V 4A power supply as specified. Using a power supply with incorrect voltage or current ratings can damage your device.
- **Power Up Safely:** Always connect the power supply before attaching the USB cable. Make sure the power supply is turned on and delivering the correct voltage before powering up the system.

### 3. Avoid Short Circuits
- **Inspect Solder Joints:** After soldering, inspect all connections to ensure there are no unintended solder bridges between pins or tracks that could cause short circuits.
- **Use Insulation:** Where necessary, use heat shrink tubing or electrical tape to insulate connections and prevent accidental shorts.

### 4. Protect Against Static Discharge
- **Ground Yourself:** Before handling sensitive components like the Arduino boards, discharge any static electricity by touching a grounded object.
- **Handle with Care:** Avoid touching the pins or components directly; hold the boards by the edges.

### 5. Test Before Full Assembly
- **Prototype First:** Test your circuit on a breadboard or in a non-permanent setup before final soldering and assembly to ensure everything works as expected.
- **Check Voltages:** Use a multimeter to check the voltages at key points in the circuit before connecting sensitive components.

## Reporting Hardware Issues

## General Safety Tips

- **Work in a Well-Ventilated Area:** Soldering should be done in a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.
- **Wear Protective Gear:** Use safety glasses and take necessary precautions when working with tools and hot soldering irons.
- **Keep Your Workspace Organized:** An organized workspace reduces the risk of accidental damage or injury.
